# Practice_Proyects

Here I upload my simple proyects that I have worked on in the past. 

Some of them are proyects that I did as a part or a course (ie. Datacamp, Dataquest, Hand's On, etc). 

Some of the newer one's are proyects that I have started on my own to develop the skills I have learned. 

I'm looking forward to delevoping my models to a higher level and to create another repo with my more "polished" end-to-end proyects.
